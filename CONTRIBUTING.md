# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because I'm always happy when someone is interested in my projects and wants to contribute to it.


## Submitting changes

Please create a GitHub Pull Request with a clear description of what you've done or changed. Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits to describe what you've changed or added.


## Coding conventions

I won't force you to use very specific standards, since I myself don't really have a coding standard on my own for bash scripts.  
But please try to avoid writing code that is too messy.
