# Argos spotify plugin

For use with [p-e-w/argos](https://github.com/p-e-w/argos).  
A simple argos plugin to control the linux spotify client with.  
Also provides information about the current song, artist and playback status.   
A couple of plugin behaviours can be controlled with a [settings/config file](./settings/spotify).

## Requirements

Well, a linux system with the spotify linux client installed (duh).  

## Some important notes

I only use and tested this script with `Ubuntu 20.04`. Some errors *may* occur on another distribution or ubuntu version.

## #TODO

- changing settings within the dropdown menu
- a simple `install.sh` to simplify using this project
